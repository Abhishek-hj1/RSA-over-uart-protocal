# RSA-over-uart-protocal
Secure UART Communication Over RSA Encryption

This repository presents the complete design, implementation, and evaluation of a secure UART communication system utilizing RSA encryption. The project is developed using Verilog HDL and deployed on a Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA platform. It integrates RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption modules with UART transmitter and receiver units to enable real-time encrypted serial communication.

The development workflow includes simulation, synthesis, and hardware validation based on the methodology described in the research paper titled {``Design and Development of UART Communication Over RSA Encryption''}. This ensures a reliable and efficient implementation of secure UART communication on FPGA.
